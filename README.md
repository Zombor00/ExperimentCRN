Implementation in pytorch of one-step ahead predictions as in Counterfactual Recurrent Network (CRN).
Based in the original paper of CRN [Estimating Counterfactual Treatment Outcomes over Time through Adversarially Balanced Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04083.pdf)https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04083.pdf)
